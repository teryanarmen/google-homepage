Cloning the Google front page.

Im using a gif to make my page look unique

So far working on the nav bar. I got most the spacing down but having trouble making the sign up be inline

I restarted

Finished most of it, was thinking of doing the rolling im feeling lucky button but I'd rather learn javascript while doing a more useful project. 

I learned how to use DevTools doing this project and strengthened my organization and got better at the display elements such as using multiple divs and having some be flex and others be inline block to make the website look exactly how I want it to.
